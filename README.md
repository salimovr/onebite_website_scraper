# onebite_pizza_scraper

From here if you want to upload this to a lambda layer, zip lambda_function.py as well as pizzareview. 

You should be able to run this in the lambda after setting up the layer.

Don't forget to change the timeout to ~1 minute, that's approximately how long it takes for the scraper to run.
